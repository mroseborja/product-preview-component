## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is my first try to code using mobile-first workflow. And I think this is a lot easier to code first from mobile view to desktop view. It has a lesser media queries.

### Continued development

Using flexbox, grid and trying mobile-first on more complex web design.

### Useful resources
